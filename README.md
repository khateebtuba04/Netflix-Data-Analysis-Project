# 🎬 Netflix Movie Data Analysis

This project is a basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix movie data using Python.  
The goal of this project is to understand movie trends, ratings, popularity, and other key attributes by analyzing a real-world dataset.
This project is designed for beginners who are learning **data analysis with Python**.

## 📌 Project Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
- To explore and understand Netflix movie data
- To clean and prepare raw data for analysis
- To analyze movie ratings, popularity, and trends
- To visualize insights using graphs and charts
- To practice Python data analysis skills using a real dataset

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name:** mymoviedb.csv  
- The dataset contains information about movies available on Netflix
- Key columns in the dataset include:
  - Movie title
  - Release year
  - Rating
  - Popularity
  - Vote count
  - Genre
  - Language

The dataset is used only for **educational and learning purposes**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas** – for data cleaning and manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – for data visualization
- **Seaborn** – for advanced visualizations

## 🔎 Steps Performed in the Project

### 1. Data Loading
- Imported the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame
- Displayed basic information about the dataset

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values
- Removed or handled null values
- Converted data types where required
- Removed unnecessary or duplicate columns

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of movie ratings
- Observed movie release trends over the years
- Identified popular and highly rated movies
- Analyzed vote counts and popularity scores

### 4. Data Visualization
- Used bar charts, histograms, and count plots
- Visualized rating distributions
- Compared popularity across movies
- Displayed trends using graphs for better understanding

## 📊 Key Insights

- Identified movies with the highest ratings
- Observed which years had more movie releases
- Found patterns between popularity and vote count
- Gained insights into audience preferences

## 📈 Output & Results

- Cleaned and structured dataset
- Clear visualizations explaining trends
- Meaningful insights derived from basic analysis
- Improved understanding of Netflix movie data
